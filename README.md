# bash_categorize_extensions
Just a simple example to perform basics (loop, if check) of bash scripting.<br>
<br>
The question example is published on my website; <br>
# http://www.ahmetgungor.com/2019/09/20/bash-exercise-1-categorize-extensions/
<br><br>
In this example;<br>
Just assume that you have bunch of files like below and you want to categorize these files by extensions.
<br>
This small script handles that.
<br>
<br>
# Task
<br>
If file extension is .mp3              ==>    Move file to Music folder in current path.
<br>
If file extension is .avi                 ==>   Move file to Video folder in current path.
<br>
If file extension is .jpeg              ==>   Move file to Photo folder in current path.
<br>
If file extension is not above     ==>   Move file to Other folder in current path.
